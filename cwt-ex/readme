Compilation Instructions
========================

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `make' to compile the package.

  2. To build documentation files type `make doc'.

  3. Optionally, type `make test' to run any self-tests that come with
     the package.

  4. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'. Also files that
     created by `make test' will be removed.
